In my past experience, I encountered the challenge of conducting extensive code reviews. It consumed a significant amount of time and impacted productivity. However, I implemented several strategies that proved highly effective in enhancing the code review process.

### Linting: Ensuring Code Consistency 🔍✨

To ensure consistent code style and formatting, I relied on linters, which closed the loop on code style queries and saved valuable review time. Integrating lint checks into the CI/CD pipeline ensured any PR not meeting the style requirements didn't proceed for review.

### Coding Style Guidelines: Streamlining Discussions 📝🎨

Creating a well-documented coding style guide was crucial. It addressed conventions beyond the scope of linting, such as variable naming and function argument limits. This streamlined discussions during code reviews, enabling faster decision-making.

### Testing: Focusing on Business Logic ✔️🧪

Detailed testing played a vital role in code reviews. By thoroughly testing the code, we could focus on business logic rather than basic functionality. We set a minimum test coverage threshold for PRs, which ensured code was well-tested before review.

### Limited Lines of Code: Enhancing Efficiency ➖📏

Introducing a limit on the number of lines of code per PR (300 lines, for example) had a positive impact on review efficiency. Smaller PRs made it easier to understand changes and identify potential issues quickly.

### Checklist: Ensuring Completeness ✅📋

Incorporating a checklist in PR messages was a game-changer. It helped us ensure all necessary tasks were completed before review, including documentation updates and environment changes.

### Pre-architecture Discussion: Aligning Understanding 🗣️🏗️

Spending a few minutes discussing architectural decisions before starting a task paid off significantly. It prevented major rewrites by aligning the team's understanding of the project's direction.

### Code Review Sessions: Fostering Learning 👥🚀

Regular code review sessions, held weekly or bi-weekly, were incredibly valuable. We collectively discussed common mistakes and reviewed code examples, fostering a learning-oriented environment.

By adopting these strategies, our code review process became more efficient and collaborative. Embracing a limited line of code per PR approach further expedited the process, leading to higher productivity and superior software development outcomes! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻
